This is the grading rubric for the Planters programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     7
 - output for large.txt matches large.txt.out 100%
 - performance will be graded based by running the program on large.txt then
   points assigned based on runtime. The program has to produce correct output
   as well.
      < 0.25 seconds	7 points
      < 0.5 seconds	6 points
      < 1.0 seconds	3 points
      < 2.0 seconds	2 points
      < 3.0 seconds	1 point
      > 3.0 seconds	0 points

Implementation	    10
 - uses a BST to store the plant box data
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members
 - no memory leaks or memory errors
 - the harvesting algorithm doesn't traverse the whole tree
 - string data is represented using char* (or char[])
 - planters.cpp is unchanged

Design		     2
 - the plantermgr class doesn't contain any implementation of the tree

Style		     1
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
