# CS163_260_projects
 Old Data Structures projects from CS260/163

All of these projects are based on Mike Noel's Data Structures course at Portland Community College.

a01 uses a triply-threaded linked list.
a02 uses a stack and a linked list.
a03 uses a hash table.
a04 uses a binary search tree.

All assignments except a04 were completed using iterative algorithms. They were designed to meet the requirements for the problem statements given.
