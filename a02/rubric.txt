This is the grading rubric for the Builders programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for huge.txt matches huge.txt.out 100% (including all
 whitespace)
 - the program runs on huge.txt in less than 1 second

Implementation	    10
 - each builder contains a stack implemented using a linked list (not array)
 - each builder contains a linkedlist
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members or those methods are marked as deleted.
 - no memory leaks
 - no memory errors
 - builders.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: builder, stack, and linkedlist
 - the builder class doesn't contain any implementation for the stack or linkedlist
 - the stack and linkedlist classes don't do any output (except for optional debugging)

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
