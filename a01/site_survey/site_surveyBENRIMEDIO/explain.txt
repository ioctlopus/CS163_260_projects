I created a small test.txt file to see what would happen if a sector with a negative value was encountered. My original datalogger.cpp did
not contain any bounds checking for sectors with negative values. As a result, it added the negative sectors to the report.
Adding bounds checking in datalogger.cpp caused the datalogger to discard the sector and its information withoud adding it to the 
badsectorlist, as a negative sector is clearly useless information.
