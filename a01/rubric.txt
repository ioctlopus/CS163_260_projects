This is the grading rubric for the Site Survey programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for large.txt matches large.txt.out 100% (including all whitespace)
 - the program runs on huge.txt in less than 1 minute

Implementation	    10
 - uses a triply-threaded linked list to store the data
 - sorts the data as it is being inserted in all three threads
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members.
 - no memory erros or leaks
 - process.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: datalogger, linkedlist, and
 surveydata
 - the datalogger class doesn't contain any linked-list behavior

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
